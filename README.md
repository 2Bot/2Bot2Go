2Bot2Go is a Discord SelfBot (a bot that runs under your account and only reacts to your commands), can be used as a standalone selfbot or complementary to 2Bot.

## How To Use

Using 2Bot2Go is a very simple process. 
1. Go to [releases](https://github.com/Strum355/2Bot2Go/releases) and download the latest binary for your relevant system. 
2. Run the executable, follow the instructions and away you go!

Be aware that the program has to be running for 2Bot2Go to work, so closing it will also kill 2Bot2Go :( Follow your OS's instructions on how to run it in the background and/or start it on startup if you so wish.

#### Extra info
For the large-emoji command, download the discord built-in emoji [here](https://noahsc.xyz/2Bot/emoji.zip) to be able to use the command with the discord built-in emoji too. Extract the zip to the same folder as where the 2Bot2Go executable file is

## Commands

All commands have to be prefixed with your chosen prefix. Commands are also case insensitive. More commands will be added soon!

| Command | Args | Result | 
| ------- | ---- | ------ |
| git     | none | Spreads the word of 2Bot2Go :D |
| findEmoji | emoji or string | goes through all your servers and shows a certain amount of emojis that match the emoji or contain the string given in its name |
| help | command or none | When given a command, it gives detailed info and help for the command. Otherwise, it lists all the commands| 
| _**Special: large-emoji**_ | emoji | This command has no command word but is called by simply giving an emoji after the prefix. E.g. if prefix is `!` then `!:pepe:` would send a large version of the emoji `:pepe:`. For built-in emojis, follow the Extra info up above |

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible or to be held accountable for your account being suspended/deleted. While selfbots technically are against Discord TOS, staff will generally turn a blind eye to it if the selfbot/API isn't being abused and the selfbot isn't being shoved in staffs faces. 2Bot2Go is distrubuted AS IS, what you do with it is your decision and responsibility. Only download 2Bot2Go from [releases](https://github.com/Strum355/2Bot2Go/releases), I am not responsible for you downloading a modified version from somewhere else and someone steals your token. Use 2Bot2Go responsibly and maturely
